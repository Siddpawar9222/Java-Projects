                       ATM Machine Operation Program

This project is a simple ATM (Automated Teller Machine) machine operation program implemented in Java using object-oriented programming principles.

                                Description

The ATM Machine Operation Program allows users to perform various banking operations such as viewing the available balance, withdrawing money, depositing money, and viewing the mini statement.

The program provides a command-line interface where users can input their choice of operation. The available options are:

View Available Balance: Displays the current available balance in the account.
Withdraw Amount: Allows the user to withdraw a specific amount from the account.
Deposit Money: Allows the user to deposit money into the account.
View Mini Statement: Shows a mini statement with recent transactions.
Exit: Exits the program and terminates the ATM session.
The program incorporates exception handling to handle potential errors or invalid user input gracefully.
